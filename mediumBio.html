  <h2>Medium Bio</h2>
  <p>Tommy McPhee (born 1998) is a media artist and researcher studying compositional abstraction through real-time synthesis. McPhee uses algorithmic aesthetics as a framework to critically examine our perception. He utilizes parallelism on a technical and conceptual level, amassing the synergy of distinct instrumentations, mediums, and performances to collectively generate antinarrative works.

    With the support of a full academic scholarship, McPhee studied Music Composition at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas and obtained his BM in May of 2021. Entering university as a predominantly commercial musician, McPhee’s studies at Lamar introduced him to a plethora of musical styles beyond his experiences in school ensembles and the local hip-hop scene. Since then, he has produced a prolific output of music that challenges conventional notions of genre, instrumentation, and form.

    McPhee obtained his master’s degree in music technology at Georgia Southern University in May of 2023, where he taught Digital Audio Workstations and Recording Studio Techniques. McPhee is currently in the second year of his DMA in Interdisciplinary Digital Media at Arizona State University, where he teaches music theory and works on the MILES (Music Immersive Learning ExperienceS) project. McPhee is pursuing a career in academia to continue his work as an algorithmic artist.</p>
