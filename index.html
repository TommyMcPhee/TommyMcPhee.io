<p>This is a rework of Sipping on Térere (2019), which was also composed for brass quintet (substituting Euphonium for Trumpet 2)</p>
<p>By far the most challenging aspect of this work was creating the real-time audio reactive visuals, which required me to learn GLSL,<p>
  <p>the shading language utilized within the OpenGL graphics rendering pipeline. In my view, this is the most feasible way of performing video<p>
    <p>synthesis using computers since it is extremely performative, platform-independent and runs directly on the graphics card. While learning<p>
      <p>the language and how to embed it within my broader C++ environment was quite difficult, it was undoubtably necessary to my future research<p>
        <p>and work. I already find it easier than Jitter (within Max) which is the video synthesis tool I have the next most experience with.<p>
          <p>It also embedds much more nicely into C++, my preferred audio programming environment, whereas using something like Jitter would<p>
            <p></p>probably necessitate OSC messages to control everything. GLSL is also exponentially more open ended as a programming tool.<p>
              <p>I think I spent at least five times as long on the visuals as the music for this work and they probably consumed about half of my total<p>
                <p>independent composition time over the course of the Fall 2023 semester.<p>
